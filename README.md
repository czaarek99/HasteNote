# HasteNote

HasteNote is a simple web based app for taking notes.
It allows each user to take up to 100 notes per account.
It's also responsive so it looks great on big and small screens.

## Live Demo
A live demo can be found at <http://coming-soon.com>
Registrations work fine, but if you just want to quickly try the
app use the test user with the credentials:

> username: TestUser  
> password: TestUserPassword
